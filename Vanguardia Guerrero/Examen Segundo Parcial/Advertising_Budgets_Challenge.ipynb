    "1. Start by cleaning the data.\n",
    "   R - Identify any null or missing data, and impute appropriate replacement values.\n",
    "   R - Describe and identify statistical parameters for each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determine the relationship between the advertising budgets and sales, and to build a predictive model that can estimate sales based on the given budgets for TV, radio, and newspaper.\n",
    "   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: \n",
    "   * Describe and visualize the data to understand the distribution and relationships between variables\n",
    "   * Calculate and plot heatmap correlation and pairwise correlations\n",
    "   **Feature Engineering**: \n",
    "   * Create any additional features that might help in the analysis. Will be explained later.\n",
    "   * Splitting data into training and test datasets. \n",
    "   * Train_Set_Size need to be 90% and Test_Set_Size 10%.\n",
    "3. Apply any machine learning algorithm on the dataset   \n",
    "   * Load the algorithm\n",
    "   * Instantiate and Fit the model to the training dataset\n",
    "   * Prediction on the test set\n",
    "   * Evaluate with 3 different metrics. \n",
    "4. Create a new feature called Area, and randomly assign observations to be rural, suburban, or urban, this variable need to have gaussian distribution.\n",
    "   * Plot the new data distribution according to the new feature.\n",
    "   * Transform feature to numerical. Create additional dummy binary variables that describe the feature:\n",
    "      - rural is coded as Area_suburban = 0 and Area_urban = 0\n",
    "      - suburban is coded as Area_suburban = 1 and Area_urban = 0\n",
    "      - urban is coded as Area_suburban = 0 and Area_urban = 1\n",
    "   * Apply Number 3 step again with this dataset.\n",
    "4. Answer next questions:\n",
    "- Is there a relationship between sales and spend various advertising channels?\n",
    "- Which is the channel with more relationship with sales?\n",
    "- Which is the model that describe both problems?\n",
    "- Which is the best channel to increase sales?\n",
    "- Which is the worst channel to increase sales?\n",
